## API

### `loadScript(src || options, callback)`

Load the given script either by passing a `src` string, or an `options` object:

```js
{
  src: '//example.com/lib.js', // same as `src` string
  http: 'http://example.com/lib.js', // `src` to load if the protocol is `http:`
  https: 'https://ssl.example.com/lib.js' // `src` to load if the protocol is `https:`
}
```
  
You can also pass in a `callback` that will be called when the script loads with `err, event`.
